# What does ENS do?

"ENS offers a secure & decentralised way to address resources both on and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names."
"ENS eliminates the need to copy or type long addresses. With ENS, you'll be able to send money to your friend at 'aardvark.eth' instead of '0x4cbe58c50480...', interact with your favorite contract at 'mycontract.eth', or visit a Swarm-hosted site at 'swarmsite.eth'."

* Owns & manages the .eth gTLD
* Translates .eth domain URLs to contract addresses

# Subdomain registration
## "Name your wallet"

Uses https://now.ens.domains/

Allows you to search for .eth domains that offer registering a subdomain, for free or a small (.005 eth at time of writing) fee.

# Subdomain registration
## How does it work?
Enter a phrase to search for, and the app will show you all available extensions for that phrase. Click the one you like best, and your web3-enabled browser will pop up a transaction confirmation window. Approve the transaction, and as soon as it's mined, the wallet you sent the transaction from has a working ENS name! You can now give anyone your new name in place of your wallet address.

# Subdomain registration
## How can I trust the owners of these domains?
In order to be listed on ENSNow, domain owners have to commit ownership of their name to a smart contract. This contract prohibits them from making any changes to the name until the permanent registrar upgrade, planned for approximately May 2019.

This means that your names are secure until at least that date. At that time, you should check back in to determine if the owner of your domain has precommitted to a migration path to the permanent registrar that will allow you to retain your name safely.
