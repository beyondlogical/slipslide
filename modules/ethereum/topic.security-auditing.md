# Public disclosure

The process of publicly disclosing a flaw in shared infrastructure, which potentially exposes many parties participating in an ecosystem to be put at risk (or almost certain attack) requires good coordination in order to minimize the negative impact to all the parties in the ecosystem.

1. Notify the development team of the project with the issue.
2. Coordinate a timeline with them for fix & disclosure.
3. Register the issue with any appropriate public registry.
4. Provide accountability: ensure they follow through.
5. If the dev team's agency doesn't cooperate, escalate to the security community.
