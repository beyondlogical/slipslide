# Confirming your transaction

Q: When can you trust that your transaction will remain in the chain of records kept and used?

--

A: Once the number of transactions after it are great enough to trust that the likelihood of it remaining in the active chain are certain.

Q: How many is that?

A: About 6-12, for most reasonable levels of confidence, but more is better.
