Why is this funny? Arthur is showing the typical economical response to being forced to interpret the organizational code that this system runs on. Who is deluded here?

Dennis the Anarcho-Syndicalist

Dennis: What I object to is you automatically treatin' me like an inferior. 
Arthur: Well, I am king. 
Dennis: Oh, king, eh? Very nice. And how'd you get that, then? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society! If there's ever going to be any progress-- 
Dennis: We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune. We take it in turns to act as sort-of-executive officer for the week-- 
Arthur: Yes. 
Dennis: But all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting-- 
Arthur: Yes, I see. 
Dennis: By a simple majority, in the case of purely internal affairs-- 
Arthur: [getting bored] Be quiet. 
Dennis: But by a two thirds majority, in the case of more major-- 
Arthur: Be quiet! I order you to be quiet!

...

Dennis: Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
Arthur: Be quiet!

# Anarcho syndicalism

* solidarity
* direct action
* direct democracy (self management)

"any hierarchy that cannot be ethically justified must either be dismantled or replaced by decentralized egalitarian control"

???
Anarcho-syndicalism (also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism)[1] is a theory of anarchism that views revolutionary industrial unionism or syndicalism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of an economy and, with that control, influence broader society. Syndicalists consider their economic theories a strategy for facilitating worker self-activity and as an alternative co-operative economic system with democratic values and production centered on meeting human needs.

The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are solidarity, direct action (action undertaken without the intervention of third parties such as politicians, bureaucrats, and arbitrators) and direct democracy, or workers' self-management. The end goal of syndicalism is to abolish the wage system, regarding it as wage slavery. Anarcho-syndicalist theory therefore generally focuses on the labour movement.[2]

Anarcho-syndicalists view the primary purpose of the state as being the defense of private property, and therefore of economic, social, and political privilege, denying most of its citizens the ability to enjoy material independence and the social autonomy that springs from it.[3]

Reflecting the anarchist philosophy from which it draws its primary inspiration, anarcho-syndicalism is centred around the idea that power corrupts and that any hierarchy that cannot be ethically justified must either be dismantled or replaced by decentralized egalitarian control.[3]

# Solidarity

"Solidarity is unity (as of a group or class) which produces or is based on unities of interests, objectives, standards, and sympathies.[1][2] It refers to the ties in a society that bind people together as one."

# Anarcho-capitalism

* voluntary society
* abolish the state
* privately funded security

???
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism Anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy and school of anarchist thought that advocates the elimination of the state in favor of self-ownership, private property and free markets. Anarcho-capitalists hold that in the absence of statute (law by centralized decrees and legislation), society tends to contractually self-regulate and civilize through the discipline of the free market (in what its proponents describe as a "voluntary society").[1][2]

In an anarcho-capitalist society, law enforcement, courts and all other security services would be operated by privately funded competitors retained by private property owners rather than centrally through compulsory taxation. Money, along with all other goods and services, would be privately and competitively provided in an open market. Personal and economic activities under anarcho-capitalism would therefore be regulated by victim-based dispute resolution organizations under tort and contract law, rather than by statute through centrally determined punishment under political monopolies.[3]

# Anarchism

"The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC among the works of Taoist philosopher Laozi.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism

Anarchism, meaning "without rulers", is a term covering various anti-authoritarian philosophies and movements which are egalitarian and socialist, which are dedicated to the replacement of states and/or governments (either capitalist governments or all governments) by various suggested alternatives such as autonomous self-realizing direct-democratic structures. Anarchism is not ochlocratic but to the contrary includes theories of structure and mutual support rooted in direct democracy and free association.

# The State

Definitions:

* A condition; a set of circumstances applying at any given time.
* High social standing or circumstance. 
* (mathematics, stochastic processes) An element of the range of the random variables that define a random process.
* Any sovereign polity; a national or city-state government.
* A political division of a federation retaining a notable degree of autonomy, as in the United States or Germany; (by extension, informal, US) any province.
* (obsolete) A form of government other than a monarchy.
* (anthropology) A society larger than a tribe. A society large enough to form a state in the sense of a government.

???
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/state

In traditional social systems, the state is the reinforcing structure, it adds overhead, it provides limits, but it also helps guarantee certain conditions and engender confidence in fair dealings. In DAO, this state is encoded in the rules executed by the smart contracts instead of people, although some outcomes will likely incentivize activity among people by transferring funds between them. Currently in representative democracy we elect officials to represent us, and we provide them with feedback, and then they pursue activity and support or reject legislation as they see representing their interests, which is in good part their voter's desire.

# Ochlocracy

???
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochlocracy

Ochlocracy (Greek: ὀχλοκρατία, okhlokratía; Latin: ochlocratia) or mob rule is the rule of government by mob or a mass of people, or, the intimidation of legitimate authorities. As a pejorative for majoritarianism, it is akin to the Latin phrase mobile vulgus meaning "the fickle crowd", from which the English term "mob" originally was derived in the 1680s.

Ochlocracy is synonymous in meaning and usage to the modern, informal term "mobocracy", which arose in the 18th century as a colloquial neologism.

Ochlocracy, or mob rule, is often incorrectly equated with tyranny of the majority; however, ochlocracy involves illegal action and does not necessitate a majority and is usually consisted of a minority.

# Democracy
## Rule of the people
![agora](../media/agora.jpg)

???
Democracy (Greek: δημοκρατία dēmokratía, literally "rule of the people"), in modern usage, is a system of government in which the citizens exercise power directly or elect representatives from among themselves to form a governing body, such as a parliament.[1] Democracy is sometimes referred to as "rule of the majority".[2] Democracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls what occurs and its outcomes.

The uncertainty of outcomes is inherent in democracy, which makes all forces struggle repeatedly for the realization of their interests, being the devolution of power from a group of people to a set of rules.

# Tyranny of the Majority 

???
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority
Electoral college : An example of mechanism design in our democracy.

American founding father Alexander Hamilton, writing to Thomas Jefferson from the Constitutional Convention, argued the same fears regarding the use of pure direct democracy by the majority to elect a demagogue who, rather than work for the benefit of all citizens, set out to either harm those in the minority or work only for those of the upper echelon. The Electoral College mechanism present in the indirect United States presidential election system, and the phenomenon of faithless electors allowed for within it, was, in part, deliberately created as a safety measure not only to prevent such a scenario, but also to prevent the use of democracy to overthrow democracy for an authoritarian, dictatorial or other system of oppressive government.[3] As articulated by Hamilton, one reason the Electoral College was created was so "that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications".

# Parlimentary Procedure

Rule of the majority with respect for the minority

Purpose: allow deliberation & arrive at the sense or the will of the assembly 

???
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure

Parliamentary procedure is the body of rules, ethics and customs governing meetings and other operations of clubs, organizations, legislative bodies and other deliberative assemblies.

At its heart is the rule of the majority with respect for the minority. Its object is to allow deliberation upon questions of interest to the organization and to arrive at the sense or the will of the assembly upon these questions.[1] Self-governing organizations follow parliamentary procedure to debate and reach group decisions—usually by vote—with the least possible friction.

Rules of order consist of rules written by the body itself (often referred to as bylaws), but also usually supplemented by a published parliamentary authority adopted by the body. Typically, national, state/provincial and other full-scale legislative assemblies have extensive internally written rules of order, whereas non-legislative bodies write and adopt a limited set of specific rules as the need arises.

In the 16th and 17th century, there were rules of order in the early Parliaments of England.[3] In the 1560s Sir Thomas Smyth began the process of writing down accepted procedures and published a book about them for the House of Commons in 1583.[3] Early rules included

== Lex Parliamentaria ==
Lex Parliamentaria; or, A treatise of the law and custom of the Parliaments of England, was a pocket manual for members of the Parliament of England first published in 1690

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason%27s_Manual_of_Legislative_Procedure
http://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/masons-manual-for-legislative-bodies.aspx

Seventy of the 99 legislative chambers in the United States use Mason's Manual as their parliamentary authority. Thirteen use Jefferson's Manual, and only 4 use Robert's Rules of Order. The recent trend has been a move to Mason's Manual. Between 1991 and 1999, at least 10 legislative assemblies changed to or added Mason's as the back-up to their chamber rules.

== Jefferson's Manual ==
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson%27s_Manual

A Manual of Parliamentary Practice for the Use of the Senate of the United States, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1801, is the first American book on parliamentary procedure. As Vice President of the United States, Jefferson served as the Senate's presiding officer from 1797 to 1801. Throughout these four years, Jefferson worked on various texts and, in early 1800, started to assemble them into a single manuscript for the Senate's use. In December 1800 he delivered his manuscript to printer Samuel Harrison Smith, who delivered the final product to Jefferson on 27 February 1801.[1]

Jefferson's Manual was based on notes Jefferson took while studying parliamentary procedure at the College of William and Mary.[2] A second edition with added material by Jefferson was printed in 1812.[3]

# Distributed Cognition
“Autonomy is where algorithmic business gets really intriguing — and becomes the next big challenge for CIOs and business leaders,” said Mr. Prentice. He described how algorithmic business has three building blocks, or functional roles:

???
* Advisors, where guidance is provided based on data inputs and encoded knowledge — for example, Apple’s Siri virtual assistant or Amazon’s recommendation engine.
* Agents, where actions are initiated based on encoded knowledge and data inputs — for example, airbag deployment systems or autonomous (self-driving) vehicles.
* Entities, where actions are initiated based on encoded knowledge and data inputs, but without human oversight.

Airplanes as organisms

Another well-researched site for analyzing distributed cognition and applying the discovered insights towards the design of more optimal systems is aviation,where both cockpits and air traffic control environments have been studied as scenes that technologically and socially distribute cognition through systems of externalized representational media. It is not the cognitive performance and expertise of any one single person or machine that is important for the continued operation or the landing and takeoff of airplanes. The cognition is distributed over the personnel, sensors, and machinery both in the plane and on the ground, including but not limited to the controllers, pilots and crew as a whole.

# Complexity Theory
# Beyond the order/chaos binary

"Organizations can be treated as complex adaptive systems (CAS) as they exhibit fundamental CAS principles like self-organization, complexity, emergence, interdependence, space of possibilities, co-evolution, chaos, and self-similarity.

???
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_theory_and_organizations

"CAS are contrasted with ordered and chaotic systems by the relationship that exists between the system and the agents which act within it.
In an ordered system the level of constraint means that all agent behaviour is limited to the rules of the system.
In a chaotic system the agents are unconstrained and susceptible to statistical and other analysis.
In a CAS, the system and the agents co-evolve; the system lightly constrains agent behaviour, but the agents modify the system by their interaction with it.
This self-organizing nature is an important characteristic of CAS; and its ability to learn to adapt, differentiate it from other self organizing systems.[3]"

* Ordered systems - the rules, 
* Chaotic systems - the participants, statistical reasoning

## The Ten Rules

The authors use a series of analogies throughout their book, summarizing their thoughts with Ten Rules:

* Diseconomies of scale - In contrast to Economies of scale, small companies have power.
* Network effect - every additional person makes the organization stronger. In contrast to adding devices to a network, members can be added to decentralized organizations with little cost.
* Power of chaos.- Decentralized "Starfish systems" accept chaos better than centralized organizations and thrive because of it.
* Knowledge at the edge - information about the organization is open to everybody.
* Everyone wants to contribute - members of a decentralized organization are more self-motivated.
* Beware the hydra response - Using the Lernaean Hydra as an analogy, attacking the top of a decentralized organization can actually make it stronger.
* Catalysts rule - In contrast to a centralized organization with a CEO as a leader, "Catalysts are important because... they inspire people to action."
* The Values Are the Organization - The authors argue that an ideology is more important to decentralized organizations.
* Measure, monitor, and manage - Despite being chaotic, decentralized organizations can still be measured.
* Flatten or be flattened - To oppose a decentralized organization, organizations may have to become more decentralized. The authors describe a "sweet spot" for organizations with a balance between centralization and decentralization.

"Unorganisation is an approach to organisational structure and design that consciously removes or avoids layers of management and bureaucracy, eschews job titles, and instead attempts to operate with the minimum of formal structure so as to become as flexible and effective as possible.

Unorganisation is not the same as disorganisation (a chaotic environment in which little can be easily or quickly achieved); neither is it the same as being disorganised, a term usually applied to industries with non-unionised labour (or just being personally untogether)."

Any member can make a proposal, which is in the form of an ethereum transaction to either send ether or execute some contract, and other members can vote in support or against the proposal. Once a predetermined amount of time and a certain number of members has voted, the proposal can be executed: the contract counts the votes and if there are enough votes it will execute the given transaction."
