# What is Ethminer?

Ethminer is an Ethash GPU mining worker: with ethminer you can mine every coin which relies on an Ethash Proof of Work thus including Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Metaverse, Musicoin, Ellaism, Pirl, Expanse and others. This is the actively maintained version of ethminer. It originates from cpp-ethereum project (where GPU mining has been discontinued) and builds on the improvements made in Genoil's fork.
