# Ticket Sales

* Fraud prevention: Arguably, the biggest value is in eliminating fraud, especially on the secondary market. Ticket touts are notorious for bulk-purchasing tickets on primary markets and reselling them at inflated prices. The average purchaser of a resold ticket to a concert or music festival pays at least 49 percent more than its face value. Profits sometimes exceed 1000 percent, according to Aventus, a blockchain-based event ticketing solution.
* Standardizing ticketing protocol: This refers to the structure of ticketing records. Most industries have standardized exchange protocols in place but nothing to cover ticketing. Blockchain introduces better control into the marketplace.
* Detailed history of payment transactions: Event managers know ticket owners’ identities and have visibility into all previous transactions, allowing them to see if a ticket has been resold and at what price.

# New applications VS New features

* New products are emerging, but so are new features for existing products and hybrids that straddle the line.

# notStupid uses of industrial blockchain

* There must be more than a few legally-separate parties that intend to collaborate for reasons that will persist beyond the honeymoon period, usually to overcome a problem or capture an opportunity which is — or can be — financially material or strategically significant to them;
* The parties must intend to control their own part of the infrastructure and prevent any other party having administrative or hegemonic control over the system or the business rules;
* The parties must intend to achieve true tamper resistance of the data, which means that they can assure anyone that they did not collude to tamper with the ledger, alter business rules or censor transactions; 
* The parties must intend to maintain surveillance resistance, ensuring that confidential business rules and transactions are not only kept private but their existence is known only to the involved parties, which means some parties even inside a permissioned private network must not always be able to see what other parties in the network are doing;
* The essential data involved must be novel digital assets.

# Essential use of industrial blockchain

* The assets are too sensitive or valuable to trust their management to any one entity, even a joint venture;
* The volume of trade rises to a point where participants begin to worry about the power they will be handing over to a controlling entity;
* Achieving a new degree of fluidity and inclusion drives the need for tiny and free-flowing trades between a wide array of parties, not just a few enterprises;
* The parties intend not simply to move inert assets around but to use novel asset structures to change incentives and alter the game in their industry.

If you aren’t exploring ways to change something about the game rules of your industry, then the probability that your intentions require the use of blockchain technology is low.

# notStupid private network use case

"This project really needs the surveillance-resistance of a private blockchain (really of a traditional, well-administrated database) while also removing the organizer from the liability of maintaining the system and ensuring the integrity of the ledger."

# Examples
* Blind Transparency - VCT coordinates drug trial participation as a trusted third party
* VIA - Value Introspection and Attestation - like VAT, each contribution is an asset, and fractional ownership of any right to taxation, tipping, etc
* Post-Coasian Companies -
