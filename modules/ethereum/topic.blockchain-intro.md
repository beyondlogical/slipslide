# Blockchain

???
Not since the Web itself has a technology promised broader and more fundamental revolution than blockchain technology. A blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger forged by consensus, combined with a system for “smart contracts” and other assistive technologies. Together these can be used to build a new generation of transactional applications that establishes trust, accountability and transparency at their core, while streamlining business processes and legal constraints.

Think of it as an operating system for marketplaces, data-sharing networks, micro-currencies, and decentralized digital communities. It has the potential to vastly reduce the cost and complexity of getting things done in the real world.

Only an Open Source, collaborative software development approach can ensure the transparency, longevity, interoperability and support required to bring blockchain technologies forward to mainstream commercial adoption.

# DAC proposal
<p align=center>
  <img src="../media/prague_golem.jpg" width="60%">
</p>

???
Daniel Larimer first proposed the concept of a "Decentralized Organized Company" in an article published on September 7, 2013.[10] https://letstalkbitcoin.com/is-bitcoin-overpaying-for-false-security#.Ui-p9WTFT7s

The DAC quote:

Think of a crypto-currency as shares in a Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC) where the source code defines the bylaws. The goal of the DAC is to earn a profit for the shareholders by performing valuable services for the free market. With this goal in mind set out to maximize shareholder value at every stage as you design the bylaws that govern operation of the DAC.

The DAC only has one way that it can acquire the services it requires to operate and that is to pay for them with shares in the decentralized company. One service that is required is transaction validation, another is security against double-spend attacks by private (for-profit) criminals. Another service that is required is a viral marketing campaign. Other services include but are not limited to privacy for the customers and defense against traffic filtering.

The goal of a for-profit DAC is to maximize value and minimize costs. In this case, we only want the DAC to pay for useful security, but no more than necessary to maximize shareholder value.

Cryptoeconomics is a practical science that focuses on the design and characterization of these protocols.

Incentivization is at the core of economics: action + value

https://www.ethnews.com/humana-other-healthcare-firms-to-launch-blockchain-pilot-for-data-sharing

On April 2, Humana, MultiPlan, Quest Diagnostics, UnitedHealth Group's Optum, and UnitedHealthcare announced their intention to launch the trial, which aims to explore an alternative to the current data storage system.

Today, a variety of healthcare entities each maintain their own copies of healthcare provider data, and reconciling the different versions of these records can be a complicated, time-consuming, and expensive process. According to the joint press release, attempts to harmonize records currently cost the healthcare industry some $2.1 billion per year.

The participating companies hope the pilot will lead to solutions that will improve patients' "access to care" in addition to saving healthcare providers money and equipping them with the most current and accurate data available.

What is suitable for blockchain scale?

Solving old problems vs engaging new opportunities

Value volatility

Efficiency vs security trade-off re-evaluation

What new opportunities will these functions create that we haven't thought of yet?
