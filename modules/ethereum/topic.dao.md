Taoism (/ˈtaʊɪzəm/, also US: /ˈdaʊ-/), also known as Daoism, is a religious or philosophical tradition of Chinese origin which emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao (Chinese: 道; pinyin: Dào; literally: "the Way", also romanized as Dao). The Tao is a fundamental idea in most Chinese philosophical schools; in Taoism, however, it denotes the principle that is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists.[1][2] Taoism differs from Confucianism by not emphasizing rigid rituals and social order.[1]
Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasize wu wei (effortless action), "naturalness", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: 慈 "compassion", 儉 "frugality", and 不敢為天下先 "humility".

# Wu wei: Taoist living
## Just act natural

Wu wei means literally "effortless action, and also inteprets as naturalness, simplicity, spontaneity.

A balance between order and chaos.

"Doing nothing [wu wei] is the famous Daoist concept for natural action, action in accord with Dao, action in which we freely follow our own way and allow other beings to do likewise. Zhuangzi, the great anarchic Daoist sage, compared it to "riding on the wind."

2013 September 19, Vitalik publishes [Bootstrapping A Decentralized Autonomous Corporation: Part I](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i-1379644274/) in bitcoinmagazine

"Most companies have some kind of mission statement; often it’s about making money for shareholders; at other times, it includes some moral imperative to do with the particular product that they are creating, and other goals like helping communities sometimes enter the mix, at least in theory. Right now, that mission statement exists only insofar as the board of directors, and ultimately the shareholders, interpret it. But what if, with the power of modern information technology, we can encode the mission statement into code; that is, create an inviolable contract that generates revenue, pays people to perform some function, and finds hardware for itself to run on, all without any need for top-down human direction?"

Vitalik Buterin proposed that after a DAO was launched, it might be organized to run without human managerial interactivity, provided the smart contracts were supported by a Turing complete platform.[11] Ethereum, built on a blockchain and launched in 2015, has been described as meeting that Turing threshold, thus enabling DAOs.

DAOStack org uses the Genesis DAO (the DAOstack project DAO), built on the DAOstack platform.

"Gen (GEN) is the DAOstack (or Genesis DAO) token that is used in staking over proposals within DAOs on the DAO stack that are using holographic consensus governance protocols (and possibly in other protocols). One good way to see this is indeed that GEN is buying collective attention."

"Each DAO has its own purpose, own value created, and accordingly own token utility model. If your DAO is making films, then perhaps your DAO tokens will be related to royalities of the films created. If your DAO creates products, than perhaps the DAO token utility is using those products (such as blockchains). If your DAO creates curated lists, and institutions or individuals want to be on those lists (for sake of PR/advertisement), then the DAO token utility could be paying for subscribing those lists.

This DAO token should be rewarded those who create the DAO value proposition.

GENs should be rewarded to a larger collective attention of auditors/predictors that is externally observing the DAOs proposals and make predictions over them.

# Holographic Consensus

<quote>
Every DAO on the DAO stack can use any governance protocols they wish, either by using existing ones or by deploying new ones themselves. We argue that super-scalable governance requires a sort of holographic consensus - and will aim at proliferating the possible space of such protocols (that provide super-scalable governance). Thus, I believe that DAOs that would like to scale significantly would prefer using holographic consensus protocols rather than not to. Important to emphasize: “holographic consensus” is not a single protocol. It’s a concept and a wide family of protocol, of which we identify the first few examples.

MKR Token Governance
( From the MakerDAO whitepaper https://makerdao.com/whitepaper/DaiDec17WP.pdf#page10 )
In addition to payment of the Stability Fee on active CDPs, the MKR token plays an important role in the governance of the Maker Platform.

Governance is done at the system level through election of an Active Proposal by MKR voters. The Active Proposal is the smart contract that has been empowered by MKR voting to gain root access to modify the internal governance variables of the Maker Platform.  Proposals can be in two forms: Single Action Proposal Contracts [SAPC], and Delegating Proposal Contracts [DPC].

Single Action Proposal Contracts are proposals that can only be executed once after gaining root access, and after execution immediately applies its changes to the internal governance variables of the Maker Platform. After the one-time execution, the SAPC deletes itself and cannot be re-used. This type of proposal is what will be used during the first phases of the system, as it is not very complicated to use, but is less flexible.  Delegating Proposal Contracts are proposals that continuously utilize their root access through second layer governance logic that is codified inside the DPC. The second layer governance logic can be relatively simple, such as defining a protocol for holding a weekly 

vote on updated risk parameters. It can also implement more advanced logic, such as restrictions on the magnitude of governance actions within defined time periods, or even delegating some or all of its permissions further to one or more third layer DPCs with or without restrictions.  Any Ethereum account can deploy valid proposal smart contracts. MKR voters can then use their MKR tokens to cast approval votes for one or more proposals that they want to elect as the Active Proposal. The smart contract that has the highest total number of approval votes from MKR voters is elected as the Active Proposal.
