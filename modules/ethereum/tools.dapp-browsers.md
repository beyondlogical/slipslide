# Cryptonite

Browser extension for protecting Crypto enthusiasts from phishing scams and fake twitter accounts.

Cryptonite is an open source browser extension that protects crypto enthusiasts from phishing scams. 

Whenever you visit a verified crypto site or social media account, the Cryptonite shield turns from black to green on your toolbar - providing an obvious indicator that you are safe. This is the only extension with this feature. If it's not green, assume the worst until you can prove otherwise.

This extension will also protect you from Twitter scams by placing a green shield beside accounts that have been verified by MetaCert Protocol. Unverified accounts have a black shield - so you know who's real and who's not.
