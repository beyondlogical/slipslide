# Mental poker

Mental poker is the common name for a set of cryptographic problems that concerns playing a fair game over distance without the need for a trusted third party.

The problem can be described thus: "How can one allow only authorized actors to have access to certain information while not using a trusted arbiter?"

In poker, this could translate to: "How can we make sure no player is stacking the deck or peeking at other players' cards when we are shuffling the deck ourselves?". In a physical card game, this would be relatively simple if the players were sitting face to face and observing each other, at least if the possibility of conventional cheating can be ruled out. However, if the players are not sitting at the same location but instead are at widely separate locations and pass the entire deck between them (using the postal mail, for instance), this suddenly becomes very difficult.
