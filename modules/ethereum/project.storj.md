# What is STORJ?

Storj is an S3-compatible platform and suite of decentralized applications that allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. Your files are encrypted, broken into little pieces and stored in a global decentralized network of computers.

# Network participants and users

* Storage node operators - participants (create capacity)
 * Provide hard drive space to add capacity to the network 
* Developers - users (use capacity)
 * Use the STORJ network to store files

Abstract:

Decentralized cloud storage represents a fundamental shift in the efficiency and economics of large-scale storage. Eliminating central control allows users to store and share data without reliance on a third-party storage provider. Decentralization mitigates the risk of data failures and outages, while simultaneously increasing the security, read performance and privacy of object storage.  Decentralization also allows market forces to optimize for less expensive storage at a greater rate than any single provider could afford. Although there are many ways to build such a system, there are some specific responsibilities any given implementation should address, including: security, compatibility, building resilience against bad actors, ensuring favorable economics for both providers and end users, and setting incentives. Based on our experience with petabytescale storage systems, we introduce a modular framework for considering these responsibilities and for building our distributed storage network.
