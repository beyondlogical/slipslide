Ethereum timeline

2013 November
After proposing a scripting language for Bitcoin and having the idea rejected by the community, Vitalik Buterin publishes the Ethereum whitepaper, proposing inclusion of a virtual machine in the network clients, the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This would allow for the execution and verification of smart contracts.

2014 January: public announcement and initial team formation: Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, and Charles Hoskinson. Initial development under a Swiss company called Ethereum Switzerland GmbH

2014 June: Ethereum Foundation founded
2014 July and August: Ethereum crowdsale, Ethereum becomes available in exchange for Bitcoin. 11.9 million Ethereum tokens were sold (about 13% of the circulating supply), raising about 18.4 million USD

2015 May: Olympic testnet launched
2015 July: "Frontier" phase of network launched. Basic functionality, no guarantees on safety or security

2015 August: Augur launches first ICO

2016 March: "Homestead" launches as the first "safe" version of the Ethereum platform
2016 May: DAO crowdfund
2016 June: DAO reentrance hack exploit

2016 July: Vote called and decision made to hard fork, in order to reverse the DAO hack transactions. ETC forks.
as a result of the exploitation of a flaw in The DAO project's smart contract software, and subsequent theft of $50 million worth of Ether, Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains – the new separate version became Ethereum (ETH) with the theft reversed, and the original continued as Ethereum Classic (ETC).
Ethereum network implemented a “hard fork” to refund the money users put into The DAO. This was accomplished using a block that moved all Ether from The DAO and child DAO accounts into a “refund contract” account that only allowed affected users to withdraw their original investment.

2016 October: "Tangerine whistle" update/fork released in response to attackers using the low cost of operations to launch Denial of Service attacks against the Ethereum network. By executing a large number of computationally expensive but gas-cheap operations on the Ethereum blockchain, the attacker was able to delay transactions on Ethereum, slowing down the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

2016 November: "Spurious Dragon" was a second hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain designed to thwart the Denial of Service attackers creating "empty accounts" in order to attack the network.

2017 October: "Byzantium" release (pt 1/2 of Metropolis, 3rd of 4 phases on the roadmap) adds zkSNARK support and other features

2019 January: ETC susceptible to double spend attacks
