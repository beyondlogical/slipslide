# Mission

The Web3 Foundation nurtures and stewards technologies and applications in the fields of decentralized web software protocols, particularly those which utilize modern cryptographic methods to safeguard decentralization, to the benefit and for the stability of the Web 3.0 ecosystem.

In order to build a better web, the Web3 Foundation will help to coordinate the efforts of teams working towards this common goal. The coordination of efforts will include helping to connect teams, cross-promote the products and protocols, as well as provide strategic grants when possible.

# Polkadot

Polkadot is a protocol that allows independent blockchains to exchange information. Polkadot is an inter-chain blockchain protocol which unlike internet messaging protocols (e.g. TCP/IP) also enforces the order and the validity of the messages between the chains. This interoperability also allows the additional benefit of scalability by creating a general environment for multiple state machines.
