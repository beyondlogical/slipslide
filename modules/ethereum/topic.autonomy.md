# Autonmous Agents (AA)

"Autonomous agents are some of the hardest things to create, because in order to be successful they need to be able to navigate in an environment that is not just complicated and rapidly changing, but also hostile. If a web hosting provider wants to be unscrupulous, they might specifically locate all instances of the service, and then replace them with nodes that cheat in some fashion; an autonomous agent must be able to detect such cheating and remove or at least neutralize cheating nodes from
the system."

# Autonomous Organizations (AO)

Algorythmic business is booming: high frequency trading, predictive marketing
    
???

This is a legal term in India regarding an organization that follows its own internal rules, whether a business or civic organization.

For us, the key seems to be "does not require interacting with a user", as in it can be engaged directly via smart contract.

There are other companies with automation at the edge already - look at credit card processors / issuers

For blockchain, "A for Autonomous requires that it be able to withstand a 51% attack" -that it will

From algorythmic agents (bots) to algorythmic businesses (AO)

Autonomy is where algorithmic business gets really intriguing — and becomes the next big challenge for CIOs and business leaders,” said Mr. Prentice. He described how algorithmic business has three building blocks, or functional roles:

* Advisors, where guidance is provided based on data inputs and encoded knowledge — for example, Apple’s Siri virtual assistant or Amazon’s recommendation engine.
* Agents, where actions are initiated based on encoded knowledge and data inputs — for example, airbag deployment systems or autonomous (self-driving) vehicles.
* Entities, where actions are initiated based on encoded knowledge and data inputs, but without human oversight.

Unlike the artificial intelligences portrayed in his Robot series, Multivac's interface is mechanized and impersonal, consisting of complex command consoles few humans can operate (with the exception of "Key Item")

# Charles Stross: Economics 2.0

???
http://singularityhacker.com/post/107072514020/economy-20 

In Charles Stross’s Accelerando "Economics 2.0 is a system that is ‘more efficient than any human-designed resource allocation schema’. It 'replaces the single-indirection layer of conventional money, and the multiple-indirection mappings of options trades, with some kind of insanely baroque object-relational framework based on the parametrized desires and subjective experiential values of the players’. Human intelligence is incapable of participating in Economics 2.0 'without dehumanizing cognitive surgery’.

# Skynet

???
In The Terminator, Skynet was a computer system developed for the U.S. military by the defense company Cyberdyne Systems; its technology was designed by Miles Bennett Dyson and his team. Skynet was originally built as a "Global Information Grid/Digital Defense Network", and later given command over all computerized military hardware and systems, including the B-2 stealth bomber fleet and America's entire nuclear weapons arsenal. The strategy behind Skynet's creation was to remove the possibility of human error and slow reaction time to guarantee a fast, efficient response to enemy attack.

# Dead hand

"Colonel General Varfolomey Korobushin, former Deputy Chief of Staff of Strategic Rocket Forces, in 1992 said that the Russians had a system, to be activated only during a crisis, that would automatically launch all missiles, triggered by a combination of light, radioactivity and overpressure, even if every nuclear-command center and all leadership were destroyed."

! Autonomy is not neutral, inherently removed from human bias. Rationality does not imply concern, only fairness. Fairness comes from rules - contracts.
