# Dapple

Dapple is a Solidity developer multitool designed to manage the growing complexity of interconnected smart contract systems.

Its core functionality encompasses three main areas:

Package management
Contract building
Deployment scripting
These concepts are related in a way unique to the smart contract ecosystem, due to each blockchain's universal singleton nature.

The central data model for Dapple is the dappfile, whose definition will normally reference IPFS objects and Ethereum contract addresses.
