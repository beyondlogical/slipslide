# The Story So Far...

*It's 2019.*

--
Bitcoin is a headline news regular and approaching a household name, despite 99% of people having never used or even owned any.

Cryptocurrencies have exploded in popularity, and blockchain has become a hot buzz-word. In the tradition of buzzwords, only a fraction of the people using it actually understand what it means, and of those who do an even smaller portion understand why it's buzz worthy.

New cryptocurrencies are emerging from something called a blockchain, and so this common denominator is receiving unprecedented levels of attention. The blockchain hype train accelerated in 2018 with the rise of the ICOs, and we had Ice Tea and consumer goods brands capitalizing on it.

New crypto projects are sprouting up, assuring users that they address the problems their project organizers see with existing crypto project. Meanwhile, some of those projects haven't even launched yet. ICOs attempting to explain the basis for their project token's valuation, with increase scrutiny by the SEC in the US and support from abroad ranging from attractive in legal countries (taxation arrangements) to punative in illegal countries. People ordering mining hardware have had it intercepted by the government and pressed into service.

# Crypto volatility

Lambos and alt-coins, securities and utility tokens, dips and peaks--the market was extremely volatile with all the hot air being blown into it. Criminals of all kind capitalized on the hope and FOMO to make short term gains at the expense of unwitting consumers hoping to get rich quick with the next big thing.

At the same time, large companies, including banks, insurance, and shipping, started to adopt versions of these networks for private use, with IBM leading the charge as an ally of the Linux foundation for Hyperledger.

Toward the end of 2018, the market prices for bitcoin, ethereum, and other crypto-currencies began to sink, and a rush to exit the market began. Consensys, the largest company in the crypto space announced significant staff reductions as it shed projects that weren't central to revenue generation. At some companies, projects are being mothballed and resource put elsewhere. At others, new projects are spinning up and the search for talent is mounting.

# The Eternal Upside

Projects are launching. Dapps are finding their market fit, and use cases are being validated. Smaller networks are proving the reality of security concerns, with smaller networks succombing to attacks that are likened to modern bank robberies. Companies are looking for developers and people who understand blockchain for them, but there's still a moat to cross in understanding how to get started, especially for folks who aren't already in close proximity to similar IT systems and skill sets.

Given the mixed signals across the market and industry, everyone is trying to predict the answer to this question:
