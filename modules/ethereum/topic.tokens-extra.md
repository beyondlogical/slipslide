# Cryptocurrency: Killer App of Decentralized Public Networks

???
There’s a corner of the decentralized application space that’s been getting lots of attention, and it revolves around the terms cryptocurrency and blockchain. It’s gathered so much attention because of cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin in particular, with similar cryptocurrencies with their own immutable public ledger implementations, such as Ethereum [etc etc].

# Blockchain

???
A blockchain is useful in part because it’s a place to store data that can be read by anyone.

---
# Decentralized Data Store

???
It’s decentralized because the data is copied across the computers running the network’s node software. All these computers work together as nodes in a network to track the state of this data and enforce rules about who can make what changes.

Some networks, such as Ethereum, also include the ability  to store code that can be executed by interacting with it once stored on the network. This network of participants shares the work of carrying out the network’s responsibilities, for the mutual benefit of all users by making the network available.

In order to track participation effort and provide a mechanism for motivating people to participate, Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrency networks implement a point tracking system natively. This is Bitcoin, Ether, [etc etc].

---
# Public ledger

???
It’s a public ledger consisting of “wallet addresses” (a public address, like an email address) and a mapped value count.

---
# Addresses

???
Permissioned data storage locations. Imagine this to be like a PO box at the post office or mail room, except with no special master access key.
( Extend this analogy with types of slots to represent the functions)

---
# Transactions
???
There are also mechanisms for transferring this value from one account to another, allowing it to be transacted, which is the basis of these points being a currency.

---
# Controlled Supply

???
This is something that is important to appreciate about cryptocurrency, and one of the common misunderstanding.
There is not an unlimited amount of Bitcoin or Ether now, and while more is still entering circulation, supply caps have been set.

"In a fully decentralized monetary system, there is no central authority that regulates the monetary base. Instead, currency is created by the nodes of a peer-to-peer network. The Bitcoin generation algorithm defines, in advance, how currency will be created and at what rate. Any currency that is generated by a malicious user that does not follow the rules will be rejected by the network and thus is worthless."

# Minting

???
Terms from currency discussion get co-opted into this system, so there’s “minting” or adding new currency, and “burning” or removing currency from the system.
Minting is an inflationary mechanism that increases the pool of currency. Newly minted currency in networks like bitcoin and Ethereum is distributed to "miners" participating in the system.

See https://www.ethereum.org/ether

# Initial Ether Minting
???
The total supply of ether and its rate of issuance was decided by the donations gathered on the 2014 presale. The results were roughly:

* 60 million ether created to contributors of the presale
* 12 Million (20% of the above) were created to the development fund, most of it going to early contributors and developers and the remaining to the Ethereum Foundation
* 3 ethers are created every block (roughly 15 seconds) to the miner of the block
* 0.625-2.625 ethers are sometimes sent to another miner if they were also able to find a solution but his block wasn't included (called uncle/aunt reward)

REF https://www.ethereum.org/ether

---
# Limits on Ether minting

???
Rate limited per year
(1) the current maximum is considered a ceiling and the new issuance under casper will not exceed it (and is expected to be much less) and (2) whatever method is ultimately picked to issue, it will be a decentralized smart contract that will not give preferential treatment to any particular group of people and whose purpose is to benefit the overall health and security of the network.

REF https://www.ethereum.org/ether

---
# Burning

???
Deflation mechanism. Bitcoin and Ethereum don't contain burning mechanism.

Looking ahead, both Bitcoin and Ether have pre-determined "market-caps"

---
# Loss

???
* Ether "stuck" in contracts that are inaccessible / unused
* Ether sent to the wrong address - waiting for someone to generate a wallet with the right address!
* Loss of access by owner - oops, lost my key!
* Death of owner
* BTC "burned" through miner reward underclaiming
* BTC from the gneesis block

TOKEN LOSS
* Stuck in contracts that can't interact with them
???

The first BTC50, included in the genesis block, cannot be spent as its transaction is not in the global database.

# Ether
Ether is to be treated as "crypto-fuel", a token whose purpose is to pay for computation, and is not intended to be used as or considered a currency, asset, share or anything else.

???
REF https://www.ethereum.org/ether

---
# Mining Ether

???
The Ethereum network is kept running by computers all over the world. In order to reward the computational costs of both processing the contracts and securing the network, there is a reward that is given to the computer that was able to create the latest block on the chain. Every 15 seconds, on average, a new block is added to the blockchain with the latest transactions processed by the network and the computer that generated this block will be awarded 3 ether. Due to the nature of the algorithm for block generation, this process (generating a proof of work) is guaranteed to be random and rewards are given in proportion to the computational power of each machine.

# Exchanges 

There’s concern in each system about the value of the currency, relative to the potential for inflation and the relative trading value against other currencies, enabled by people and entities who are willing to hold multiple currencies and act as an exchange.

---
# Trading Value 

???
As with every market, people looking to make a margin work to predict and manipulate these relative trading values. Cryptocurrency is novel in several ways, but it’s still an expression of very old concepts of value, possession, and transaction.

---
# Token Fungibility
???
So far, these tokens are all points in the same counter system, they’re all equivalent: a dollar is worth any dollar, all gold coins from Big Y are worth a loaf of garlic bread or a roast chicken.

---
# USD: Semi-Fungibile?
???
One interesting aspect of the US dollar is that they have serial numbers. This mean each has a unique ID, and while the value is “fungible” in that they are all worth the same, they can be tracked individually. [ Was this always true? Look into that system ]

# Token economies in crypto
???
These come in a variety of flavors, but each implements that classic owner/value store ledger concept and makes its own case for why ownership of these tokens is useful. Unlike layer 1 crypto, this layer 2 currency isn’t inherently tied to the function of the network, but the function of the application into which it is integrated. 

---
# Token systems

???
Aside: token systems in our environment
* Credit card points
* Airline & train points
* Casino chips & arcade tokens
* Farmer’s market EBT scrip - "wooden nickels"
* Store reward coins (Big Y’s 3 color coins)
* Gas points
* In-game currency in online games
* Festival food tickets

[ divide these into categories by ability to transact ]

---
# Transferrability
???
Sometimes certain economic aspects of these tokens is restricted--in particular, the ability to transfer ownership. Without that, the token is stuck in a single relationship: the holder to the system owner. But if tokens can be transferred, now the relationship is one-to-many and the potential for a market to emerge.

# Suitability
???
Suitability: what properties of these systems make them useful or present challenges to use? What inherent disadvantages are there, and what does the state of involvement in the network / use of the app / interest in the token have to do with the value of the token.

# Unilateral changes to token value

![Ubi changes terms](../media/ubi-club-points.png)

???
With a closely held token system, the minter can potentially change the potential value of a token at will, even greatly reducing it to limit their exposure to risk, i.e., value of the tokens in circulation.
