# Curated news feed

An uncensorable platform for content creators.

Step 1 - A content creator publishes a piece of content online (e.g. Youtube, Torrent, etc.)
Step 2 - They broadcast a link to this content on the Ethereum network for a small fee (approx. 5c worth of gas.)
Step 3 - Their Subby subscribers get it on their newsfeed directly from the Ethereum network, at no cost.
