# American Express joins Ripplenet

Compared with the traditional payment process, Ripple’s blockchain-enabled payments simplify connections with intermediaries and provide immediate end-to-end visibility into the transaction status and cost.

What’s more, FXIP’s use of RippleNet will maintain the level of security that American Express customers have come to know and expect.

“We’ve already seen evidence that blockchain technology is playing a transformational role in the way customers are served,” said Greg Keeley, executive vice president of global corporate payments at American Express.

“Not only does this partnership with Ripple help decrease the time it takes for international transactions to be processed, it can make our transactions more effective for our customers,” Keeley added.
