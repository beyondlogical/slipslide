# What is Grin?


---
# Why?


---
# Private

Grin has no amounts and no addresses. Transactions can be trivially aggregated. To hide where a newly created transaction comes from, it gets relayed privately (a "random walk") among peers before it is publicly announced. 

---
# Open

Grin is developed openly, by developers distributed all over the world. It's not controlled by any company, foundation or individual. The coin distribution is designed to be as fair (but not gratis) as is known to be possible. 

---
# MimbleWimble 

MimbleWimble leverages cryptography to allow most of the past transaction data to be removed. This guarantees Grin won't crumble under its own weight in the long term. 

"a radically different approach to transaction construction from Bitcoin, sup- porting noninteractive merging and cut-through of transactions,confidential transactions, and full verification of the current chainstate without requiring new users to verify the full history of any coins."
