The Lightning Network scales blockchains and enables trust-minimized instant payments by keeping most transactions off-chain and leveraging the security of the underlying blockchain as an arbitration layer.

This is accomplished primarily through "payment-channels‚Äù, wherein two parties commit funds and pay each other by updating the balance redeemable by either party in the channel. This process is instant and saves users from having to wait for block confirmations before they can render goods or services.

Payment channels are trust-minimized, since any attempt to defraud the current agreed-upon balance in the channel results in the complete forfeiture of funds by the liable party.
