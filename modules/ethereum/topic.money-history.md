# The coincidence of wants

One of the primary issues with direct barter systems: alignment of wants between the parties.
A medium of exchange separates the concerns with a layer of abstraction to the value being transacted that makes the value fungible while the assets remain non-fungible.

# Receipts

???
The word “receipt” comes from the Old Norman French word for recipe and the Latin word to receive. A receipt is “A written acknowledgment that a specified article or sum of money has been received.”

Writing itself may have been invented as a way to create receipts. Writing that used symbols rather than pictures was invented in Samaria around 3200 BCE

The oldest receipt ever found was for five sheep, one lamb and four grass-fed male kids. The receipt was given to a man named Alulu. It was a piece of clay about one inch by one inch and a half inch thick. 

Papyrus receipts have been found dating from the reign of Ramses II (1278 -1237 BCE). They recorded purchases of things like cattle, grain and beer.

# Currency - a store of value
(n) Currency : Middle English: curraunt, "in circulation"
<img src="../media/currency.jpg" style="width:100%">

???
A currency (from Middle English: curraunt, "in circulation", from Latin: currens, -entis), in the most specific use of the word, refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins.[1][2] A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation.[3] Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies.[4] Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance.

In this first stage of currency, metals were used as symbols to represent value stored in the form of commodities. This formed the basis of trade in the Fertile Crescent for over 1500 years. However, the collapse of the Near Eastern trading system pointed to a flaw: in an era where there was no place that was safe to store value, the value of a circulating medium could only be as sound as the forces that defended that store. Trade could only reach as far as the credibility of that military.

# Coins
![Coins](../media/coins-electrum.jpg)

The first coins were developed in Iron Age Anatolia around the 7th and 6th centuries BC. The first coins were made in Lydia during the reign of King Alyattes, from a naturally occurring material called electrum, a variable mix of gold and silver (with about 54% gold and 44% silver), and were in use in Lydia and surrounding areas for about 80 years.

# Fungibility

Fungible: (of goods contracted for without an individual specimen being specified) able to replace or be replaced by another identical item; mutually interchangeable.

Coins are useful as fungible tokens, making calculation convenient via simple counting.
"Clipping" - taking some of the metal off a coin - impacts fungibility if the value is in the metal, but not if it's still considered a full coin for exchange purposes.

A ledger is the principal book or computer file for recording and totaling economic transactions measured in terms of a monetary unit of account by account type, with debits and credits in separate columns and a beginning monetary balance and ending monetary balance for each account.

For every debit recorded in a ledger, there must be a corresponding credit so that the debits equal the credits in the grand totals.

* Transaction: exchange between 2 or more parties

# Hawala
## "money transfer without money movement"

![Hawala](../media/hawala.png)

???
ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawala

In conjunction with the silk road, a system of credit based on trust among a network of bankers called Hawalanders, often businesses with some other function that provide this as a service.

"The unique feature of the system is that no promissory instruments are exchanged between the hawala brokers; the transaction takes place entirely on the honour system."

"In addition to commissions, hawala brokers often earn their profits through bypassing official exchange rates."

"Today, hawala is probably used mostly for migrant workers' remittances to their countries of origin."

Potential for use by terrorists or other undesireables has led to outlawing.

# Wampum
<p align=center>
    <img src="../media/Wampum_ej_perry.jpg" style="width:100%">
</p>

???
Wampum, ke'kwuk, squau-tho-won; all are Algonquian words for shell beads or string of shell beads. Wampumpeage is a Narragansett word for "white beads strung". Throughout northeastern America, wampum was used for jewelry, gifts, communication, historical record of important events, religious ceremonies, and trade. It was the earliest form of currency known in North America. Its value was derived from the difficulty involved in producing the cylindrical bead from both Quahog and Whelk, and the scarcity of suitable shells. White beads were made from Whelk, purple-blackish from Quahog. 

Clams were found only at the ocean, but wampum traded far inland. Sea-shell money of a variety of types could be found in tribes across the American continent. The Iriquois managed to collect the largest wampum treasure of any tribe, without venturing anywhere near the clam's habitat. Only a handful of tribes, such as the Narragansetts, specialized in manufacturing wampum, while hundreds of other tribes, many of them hunter-gatherers, used it. Wampum pendants came in a variety of lengths, with the number of beads proportional to the length. Pendants could be cut or joined to form a pendant of length equal to the price paid.

This is an example of proof of work, which we'll see again later in "proof-of-work" systems

![US minted gold discs](../media/US-mint-gold-discs.png)

???
The gold had been purchased by the Saudis from the U.S. Treasury by converting U.S. dollars into gold at the statutory $35 rate. This was back when the U.S. was still on a gold standard and the gold window was still open. The gold in their possession, the Saudis had then asked the U.S. Mint to turn it into discs. This wasn’t the first order that the Mint had completed for Saudi Arabia, one of Boosel’s correspondents pointed out. It had previously produced silver riyal coins as well as copper “girshs”.

When the Saudi monarch Ibn Saud and ARAMCO inked their deal in 1933, the terms of the deal stipulated that for each ton of oil produced, ARAMCO owed the Saudi government a royalty of four gold shillings. This amount was payable in gold sovereigns, a British coin that circulated widely in the Middle East at the time. Each sovereign contained 0.2354 ounces of gold.
The sovereign, however, had been discontinued. For the most part, the Brits these coins by 1917, and so their supply was limited. 
That the discs were stand-ins for sovereigns is underlined by the fact that the Philadelphia Mint had produced the 1947 issue with the exact same specifications as a British sovereign.3 Both sovereigns and discs contained 0.2354 ounces of gold and were of a fineness or purity of 0.9167.

There is a much easier answer to Boosel’s frustrated plea for “the Why” behind the discs. Like most nations in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia didn’t have its own banknotes. Its monetary system was entirely reliant on precious metals coins. But it didn’t produce its own coinage. For smaller transactions, Saudis relied primarily on foreign silver coins including the ubiquitous
, a coin minted in Austria. The Indian rupee, which circulated widely in the Middle East, was equally important. For larger exchanges, Saudis used British gold sovereigns.

# Spahr and the Gold Standard League

???

This isn’t to say that there was no connection at all between the Treasury and ARAMCO. The FRASER documents mention several instances of cooperation between the two. For instance, in 1948 the Treasury helped to facilitate $82 million in ARAMCO sovereign purchases by connecting it with foreign governments that held coin inventories (including the Argentinean deal mentioned above).5 But the Treasury only pointed ARAMCO in the right direction, it didn’t actually participate in the deal itself.

The Treasury, which had banned gold coins from circulation only eleven years before, feared Spahr and his ideas.6 By minting coins for foreign governments and helping companies purchase sovereigns, the Treasury risked drawing Spahr’s anger, providing him with the sort of fuel that he required to spark a public debate on the issue of gold coinage. Luckily for the Treasury, neither the Aramco sovereigns nor the coins sold directly to Saudi Arabia attracted Spahr’s attention or generated public complaints. “Skillful handling of reporters no doubt helped head off the chance of embarrassment,” wrote one official.
