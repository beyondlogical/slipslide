# Overview

Simple Record is a very basic "Hello world" smart contract. It includes a solidity file (.sol) and a hypertext file (.html) that contains some css and javascript to provide a front-end. The Javascript uses the web3.js library to interact with a node (called a provider) on the Ethereum network.
