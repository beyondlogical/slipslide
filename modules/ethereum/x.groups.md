# Stages of group development

* Forming (pretending to get on or get along with others)
* Storming (letting down the politeness barrier and trying to get down to the issues even if tempers flare up)
* Norming (getting used to each other and developing trust and productivity)
* Performing (working in a group to a common goal on a highly efficient and cooperative basis)
* Adjourning & Transforming - dissolution of the group identity, with possible incorporation into a new entity

"Ant colonies use dynamic networks of brief interactions to adjust to changing conditions. No individual ant knows what’s going on. Each ant just keeps track of its recent experience meeting other ants, either in one-on-one encounters when ants touch antennae, or when an ant encounters a chemical deposited by another."

Are AI more like another species or a tool?

When do they get identity?

# Cybernetics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics

Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary[1] approach for exploring regulatory systems—their structures, constraints, and possibilities. Norbert Wiener defined cybernetics in 1948 as "the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine."[2] In the 21st century, the term is often used in a rather loose way to imply "control of any system using technology." In other words, it is the scientific study of how humans, animals and machines control and communicate with each other.

# Zero-sum games

Strictly competitive games: 
Example: Cutting a cake, rock-paper-scissors, poker, Monopoly

???
"a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero."

Zero-sum games are most often solved with the minimax theorem which is closely related to linear programming duality,[1] or with Nash equilibrium.

# Non-zero sum games

May be either cooperative or competitive.
