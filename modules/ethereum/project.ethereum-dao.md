The DAO was intended to operate as "a hub that disperses funds (currently in Ether, the Ethereum value token) to projects".

The DAO’s Mission: To blaze a new path in business organization for the betterment of its members, existing simultaneously nowhere and everywhere and operating solely with the steadfast iron will of unstoppable code.

Features:
"complete transparency, total shareholder control, unprecedented flexibility, and autonomous governance"

===== BEGIN SIGNED MESSAGE =====

To the DAO and the Ethereum community,
 
I have carefully examined the code of The DAO and decided to participate after finding the feature where splitting is rewarded with additional ether. I have made use of this feature and have rightfully claimed 3,641,694 ether, and would like to thank the DAO for this reward. It is my understanding that the DAO code contains this feature to promote decentralization and encourage the creation of "child DAOs".
 
I am disappointed by those who are characterizing the use of this intentional feature as "theft". I am making use of this explicitly coded feature as per the smart contract terms and my law firm has advised me that my action is fully compliant with United States criminal and tort law. For reference please review the terms of the DAO:
 
"The terms of The DAO Creation are set forth in the smart contract code existing on the Ethereum blockchain at 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413. Nothing in this explanation of terms or in any other document or communication may modify or add any additional obligations or guarantees beyond those set forth in The DAO’s code. Any and all explanatory terms or descriptions are merely offered for educational purposes and do not supercede or modify the express terms of The DAO’s code set forth on the blockchain; to the extent you believe there to be any conflict or discrepancy between the descriptions offered here and the functionality of The DAO’s code at 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413, The DAO’s code controls and sets forth all terms of The DAO Creation."
 
A soft or hard fork would amount to seizure of my legitimate and rightful ether, claimed legally through the terms of a smart contract. Such fork would permanently and irrevocably ruin all confidence in not only Ethereum but also the in the field of smart contracts and blockchain technology. Many large Ethereum holders will dump their ether, and developers, researchers, and companies will leave Ethereum. Make no mistake: any fork, soft or hard, will further damage Ethereum and destroy its reputation and appeal.
 
I reserve all rights to take any and all legal action against any accomplices of illegitimate theft, freezing, or seizure of my legitimate ether, and am actively working with my law firm. Those accomplices will be receiving Cease and Desist notices in the mail shortly.
 
I hope this event becomes an valuable learning experience for the Ethereum community and wish you all the best of luck.
 
Yours truly,
"The Attacker"

# Code as law

???
While the attacker asserts that this is all legal and within the scope of the rules (the code), the community votes with their feet to hard fork. The choice is left up to the community using the system, not the people running the system, so who is there to be culpable. Final arbitration by community action is never off the table, although it may be significantly harder to gather that consensus as we move forward.

Code may be law, but only within the scope of the system. Not having the threat of violence hanging over them to oblige the system, people are free to vote with their feet. This is the free market in action.

# Forking is a feature!

???
Forking is the opportunity of the community to follow a particular version of an outcome by voting with their feet (and software config) and following a particular upgrade path over another.

The alternative to giving the community the choice would be to force it on them, either through design (inability to do otherwise, but this is OPEN SOURCE software, so that's not possible) or violence... as we've seen many countries resort to when it comes to the public attempting to engage in mining or using cryptocurrency.
