# Types of value

One way to slice it, based on Chris Burniske's "Cryptoassets" framework:

1. .green[Cryptocurrencies] native network value unit, used to incentivize network participation
2. .blue[Cryptocommodities] constructed value unit - offers provision of a commodity such as data, storage capacity, or computing power
3. .yellow[Cryptotokens] constructed value unit - provide access to goods or services, physical or digital. Deeds, licenses

# Sources of value

1. Utility - what can it do now
2. Speculation - what might it be worth later

# Evaluating assets (direct valuation)

By definition, then, each cryptoasset serves as a currency in the protocol economy it supports. Since the equation of exchange is used to understand the flow of money needed to support an economy, it becomes a cornerstone to cryptoasset valuations.

The equation of exchange is MV = PQ, and when applied to crypto my interpretation is:

    M = size of the asset base
    V = velocity of the asset
    P = price of the digital resource being provisioned
    Q = quantity of the digital resource being provisioned

    A cryptoasset valuation is largely comprised of solving for M, where M = PQ / V. M is the size of the monetary base necessary to support a cryptoeconomy of size PQ, at velocity V.

# Evaluating projects (indirect valuation)

* Whitepaper
* Decentralization edge of a cryptoasset
* Valuation of the crypto network
* Community and developer support
* Relation to crypto siblings (e.g. did they fork, is it an ERC20, new blockchain, who are competitors?)
* Issuance model (how the token or coins are minted, total circulating supply, inflationary or deflationary etc.)

# Lack of demand trumps supply

1. People will overpay for speculative value
2. Prices drop when natural utility doesn't arrive
3. Demand follows price
4. Supply follows demand
