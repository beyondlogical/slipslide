# Why would I use a blockchain explorer?

* Transactions: search and view all transactions — pending, internal, and token
* Addresses: check your balance and tokens, and take a peek at other addresses
* Blocks: see block miners, transactions, rewards, and other relevant data
* Tokens: Explore tokens: name, market cap, price, daily volume, change, etc
