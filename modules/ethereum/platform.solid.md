# What is Solid?

Solid is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, taking place at MIT. The project aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy.

Solid (derived from "social linked data") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible and it relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols.

At a glance, here is what Solid offers...

---
# True data ownership

Users should have the freedom to choose where their data resides and who is allowed to access it. By decoupling content from the application itself, users are now able to do so.

---
# Modular design

Because applications are decoupled from the data they produce, users will be able to avoid vendor lock-in, seamlessly switching between apps and personal data storage servers, without losing any data or social connections.

---
# Reusing existing data

Developers will be able to easily innovate by creating new apps or improving current apps, all while reusing existing data that was created by other apps.

# JS utilities
* solid-auth-client allows us to perform authenticated retrieval of data from pods
* RDFlib lets us parse and process that data

---
# solid-auth-client

The solid-auth-client library helps us with authenticating the user and securely fetching files from their pod. You need the following components:

---
# RDFlib.js

RDFlib.js is a JavaScript library that allows us to interact with Linked Data stored in Solid pods. You can obtain it from https://linkeddata.github.io/rdflib.js/dist/rdflib.min.js
