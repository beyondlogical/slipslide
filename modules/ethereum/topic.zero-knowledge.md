# What is a Zero Knowledge proof?

"Zero Knowledge Proofs are a cutting edge cryptographic tool that is starting to see adoption. This breakthrough technology forms the basis of several cryptographic applications, improving the trade-offs between data privacy and integrity. Zero Knowledge Proofs allow a prover to convince a verifier that some computational statement is correct without revealing any information except the veracity of the statement."

# Properties of zero knowledge proofs

* completeness: a honest prover is able to convince a honest verifier about the truth of a statement
* soundness: a malicious prover is not able to convince a honest verifier about the falseness of a statement
* zero-knowledge: while convincing the honest verifier, a prover does not reveal anything about the statement other than the truth of the statement
