# Buterin's 3 axes of decentralization

![3 axes of decentralization](../media/decentralization-3-axes.png)

* Architectural (de)centralization — how many physical computers is a system made up of? How many of those computers can it tolerate breaking down at any single time?

* Political (de)centralization — how many individuals or organizations ultimately control the computers that the system is made up of?

* Logical (de)centralization — does the interface and data structures that the system presents and maintains look more like a single monolithic object, or an amorphous swarm?”

# Blockchain as decentralized network

Blockchains are '''politically decentralized''' (no one controls them) and '''architecturally decentralized''' (no infrastructural central point of failure) but they are '''logically centralized''' (there is one commonly agreed state and the system behaves like a single computer)

# Decentralized Applications (DA)

"A decentralized application is similar to a smart contract, but different in two key ways. First of all, a decentralized application has an unbounded number of participants on all sides of the market. Second, a decentralized application need not be necessarily financial."

# Decentralized Organizations (DO)

"In general, a human organization can be defined as combination of two things: a set of property, and a protocol for a set of individuals, which may or may not be divided into certain classes with different conditions for entering or leaving the set, to interact with each other including rules for under what circumstances the individuals may use certain parts of the property."

"a decentralized organization involves a set of humans interacting with each other according to a protocol specified in code, and enforced on the blockchain."

"the holy grail"

"it is an entity that lives on the internet and exists autonomously, but also heavily relies on hiring individuals to perform certain tasks that the automaton itself cannot do."

# DO vs DAO

"... in a DO the humans are the ones making the decisions, and a DAO is something that, in some fashion, makes decisions for itself. This is a surprisingly tricky distinction to define because, as dictatorships are always keen to point out, there is really no difference between a certain set of actors making decisions directly and that set of actors controlling all of the information through which decisions are made. In Bitcoin, a 51% attack between a small number of mining pools can make the blockchain reverse transactions, and in a hypothetical decentralized autonomous corporation the providers of the data inputs can all collude to make the DAC think that sending all of its money to1FxkfJQLJTXpW6QmxGT6oF43ZH959ns8Cq constitutes paying for a million nodes’ worth of computing power for ten years. However, there is obviously a meaningful distinction between the two, and so we do need to define it."

"DOs and DAOs are both vulnerable to collusion attacks, where (in the best case) a majority or (in worse cases) a significant percentage of a certain type of members collude to specifically direct the D*O’s activity. However, the difference is this: in a DAO collusion attacks are treated as a bug, whereas in a DO they are a feature. In a democracy, for example, the whole point is that a plurality of members choose what they like best and that solution gets executed; in Bitcoin’s on the other hand, the “default” behavior that happens when everyone acts according to individual interest without any desire for a specific outcome is the intent, and a 51% attack to favor a specific blockchain is an aberration.

# Decentralized Programmable Organisation (DPO)

If it's programmable externally, and not a self-programming automaton (AI), is it really a DAO? Perhaps Decentralized Programmable Organisation is more accurate?
